    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Simon is a memory game where the player has to repeat a sequence of colors
      and sounds generated by the game. The sequence gets longer with each
      successful round.
    </p>

    <h2>How to Play</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Press any key to start the game.</li>
      <li>Watch the sequence of colors and listen to the sounds.</li>
      <li>
        Repeat the sequence by clicking the colored buttons in the same order.
      </li>
      <li>If you make a mistake, the game will end.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Features</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Four colored buttons: green, red, yellow, and blue.</li>
      <li>Sounds associated with each color.</li>
      <li>Increasing difficulty with longer sequences.</li>
      <li>Visual and audio feedback for user interaction.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Sounds</h2>
    <p>
      Each button plays a unique sound when pressed. A wrong sound plays when
      the player makes a mistake.
    </p>

    <h2>Controls</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Use the keyboard to start the game.</li>
      <li>Use the mouse or touch to click the colored buttons.</li>
    </ul>
